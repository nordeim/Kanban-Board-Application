awesome job! please turn your detailed `UX Structure Plan` for the YouTube sponsorship workflow into an `UI Implementation Plan` using Shadcn-UI components. Update your plan document with the appropriate Shadcn-UI component to be used in the `UI structure` and where. And you should only write the name of the appropriate components to be used besides the structure nodes. Do not add the actual code yet. please use extensive online search to carefully research the correct Shadcn-UI component label to use for each node in the structure. Do not make up the Shadcn-UI component names. in the actual coding planning stage, we must be able to map each Shadcn-UI label to a working code snippet. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically how to create the best Shadcn-UI components mapping for your `UI Structure Plan` based on the actual component labels in the actual current Shadcn-UI library. apply rigorous and meticulous methodology and approach to think, explore, then create a detailed execution plan, then create the actual mapping `UI Structure Tree to Shadcn-UI Mapping` document in markdown format. please to your utmost best to surprise with your brilliant design. thank you and good luck!
