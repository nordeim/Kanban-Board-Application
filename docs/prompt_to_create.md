Please act as a Lead UX Architect. Your task is to create a detailed UX Structure Plan for a web application designed to manage a YouTube sponsorship workflow. The final output must be a single Markdown (.md) file. The structure of this file is critical: it must use a hierarchical, indented list with box-drawing characters (like ├── and └──) to create a clear tree structure, exactly like the provided reference style. 

**Application Concept:** A Kanban board interface for a creator to manage sponsorship deals.

**Required Structure and Content for the .md file:** Please create the plan with the following four main sections:  
1. Navigation Flow: Outline the primary user journey through the application.  
2. Login Page Structure: Detail the layout and all components of the login screen.  
3. Dashboard Page Structure: This is the main Kanban board view. Break down its layout from the header down to the individual details on a sponsorship card. Ensure you list all nine stages as columns within the Kanban board structure.  
4. "Add New Deal" Modal Structure: Describe the layout and form elements of the popup modal used for creating a new deal.  

Your final output should be a single block of text in the specified markdown format, ready to be saved as an .md file. Do not write any narrative text outside of the plan itself. (Example of the required format for a single element) └── Sign In Button

Now create a detailed UX Structure Plan for the YouTube sponsorship workflow Kanban board application. Let us design this as a comprehensive markdown file with the hierarchical tree structure requested.

awesome job! please put on the same deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically to create a detailed and comprehensive `Project Requirements Document` in markdown document that matches your re-imagined implementation. then create an awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repository to host this project. this document will guide any new developer to build the whole codebase with confidence and accuracy, clear and logical description that gives no ambiguity to execute the coding. thank you and good luck!

use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply re-imagine an equally awesome and comprehensive and informative `README.md` for the new GitHub repository at https://github.com/nordeim/Kanban-Board-Application.git  to host your re-imagined design. make your README so compelling that new contributors will be immediately attracted to this awesomely gorgeous e-commerce platform. use at least 4000 words for the `README/md` in markdown format, add the following sections at appropriate point / sequence:

1. add / update a section to show / describe the project codebase file hierarchy
2. add / update a section for a flowchart diagram to describe the interactions between various files and modules
3. add / update a section to list and describe the files in the codebase file hierarchy 
4. Current features implemented (partially or fully), Roadmap for suggested improvements divided into two sections, one for the immediate and one for the long-term goals.
5. Clear and detailed deployment guide starting from the GitHub repository
