awesome job! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to explore deeply and thoroughly for the best implementation option to create a project-specific `GEMINI.md` file to maximize codebase understanding and agent effectiveness. then plan before execute cautiously to create a "re-imagined" document  with the following goal:

A concise yet comprehensive Markdown file capturing all essential information about the target project repository to guide both Claude Code and new human developers.

**Instructions:**

1. Analyze the entire codebase—including all source files, configuration files, dependencies, scripts, existing documentation, and development utilities.
2. Prioritize actionable and referenceable information that:
    - Documents the project's architecture, main logic entry points, and core workflows
    - Lists explicit build, test, lint, and run commands (with copy/pasteable examples)
    - Describes environment setup, tool/permissions requirements, and configuration details
    - Details code style conventions, file/class naming, and contribution guidelines
    - Summarizes important files/directories, their function, and notable integration points
    - Notes project-specific alerts, “gotchas,” or exceptions (e.g., non-standard build steps, known issues)
    - Includes data storage, third-party integrations, and any automation or agent-specific setup
3. Use declarative formatting: clear headings, bullet points, and fenced code blocks for commands.
4. Omit irrelevant sections for simple projects and add only relevant advanced details for complex projects.
5. Ensure language is direct, supportive, and consistent with standard Markdown formatting.
6. For each section, if uncertainty exists, verify by checking across multiple files and using inference only if strictly necessary—mark inferred content clearly.
7. Edit iteratively for clarity and accuracy. Emphasize instructions with “IMPORTANT” or “YOU MUST” when specific actions ensure safety or success.
8. If applicable, reference how to customize agent permissions (e.g., allowed tools or GH integration).
9. Only include content that would accelerate onboarding or agent operation—exclude redundant or purely boilerplate text.

Below is your output structure guideline. Omit any section not relevant to this specific codebase.
